        <content><![CDATA[OpenCms has a build in module API (which is in fact a Java interface). All modules that use that
API are in terms of the LGPL "works that use the library" and therefore are not bound by the LGPL
license. 
<br />
<br />However, if additions or changes to the core system are made, the result is a derivative
work, and certain restrictions apply, the most important being that the license used for the
derivative work must also be the LGPL. 
<br />
<br />So companies can develop their additions to OpenCms as a module and choose any license they
like. However, the OpenCms core system and all enhancements or additions to it will stay Open
Source.]]></content>
