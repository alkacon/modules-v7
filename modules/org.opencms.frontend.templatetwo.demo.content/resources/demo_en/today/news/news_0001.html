        <content><![CDATA[<p>Berlin - In the hope of a bloomy summer trade lots of German nurseries offer their customers an All- Inclusive Package.</p>
<p>Beside an extensive client counselling, which flowertype most suitable for the customer is, the nurseries offer also the delivery and implementation of the selected plants. After a successful pollination of the nursery-owned bees, the nursery control the single growing stages and work against vermin.</p>
<p>This service allows people without a &quot;green thumb&quot; to have a beautiful garden. In urban areas this service is also offered for balcony plants.</p>
<p>Berlin nursery foreman, Arno Amaryllis, is one of the first who offer this all-inclusive service. Competitors enlarged this service, thus they cull the flowers and deliver these as a bouquet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content>
